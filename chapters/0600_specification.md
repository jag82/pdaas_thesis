Specification
==========================================



Based on all ideas from preceding discussions a first draft of the *PDaaS* Specification has been 
developed, which can be found as an [attachment](#spec-draft) to this work.
Not every concluded decision has yet been applied but various important aspects are already 
outlined, so that first implementations can start to be built upon them, but it still leaves much 
room for followup work.
It must be recognized though, that in its current state it has no claim of completeness, continuity
or accuracy at this time. Frequent changes are to be expected in the future.
