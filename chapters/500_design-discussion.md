Design Discussion
==========================================



The following chapter documents the processes of a variety of design decisions, examines possible 
issues emerging alongside, and discuses different solutions obtained from several perspectives in 
order to evaluate their advantages and disadvantages. Not every issue gets its deserved room, but 
major aspects will be addressed. In short, the majority of the project's conceptual work is done 
below.

The end of every subchapter includes a section containing a summary of conclusions based on the 
prior discussions related to that topic of that subchapter.
