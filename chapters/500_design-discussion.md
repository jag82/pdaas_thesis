Design Discussion
==========================================



The following chapter contains the greater part of the project's conceptual work. It documents the 
processes of a variety of design decisions, examines possible issues emerging alongside, and 
discuses different solutions obtained from several perspectives in order to evaluate their 
advantages and disadvantages. Not every issue gets its deserved room, but major aspects will be 
addressed.

The end of every subchapter includes a section containing a summary of conclusions based on the 
prior discussions related to that topic of that subchapter.
